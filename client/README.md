## To consider
The main building blocks of the application get automatically generated from the swagger json of OJP-Proxy. This 
means a connection to the backend is needed in order to fully use the application.

# Instructions

## Project Setup
To install all dependencies run the following command: 

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development
This command runs the application in dev mode meaning there is a Hot-Reload on changes:

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production
To build the application for production run the following command.
This creates a `dist` folder with the built project.

```sh

```
